<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    JavaFX allows you to create Java applications with a modern, 
    hardware-accelerated user interface that is highly portable. 
</p>
<p>
    This tutorial will help you to write a JavaFX 11 application and run it 
    on desktop platforms. For information on how to run JavaFX applications on
    mobile platforms, please see

</p>
<p>
    JavaFX 11 builds on top of Java 11, which is planned to be released in the same time-frame - September 25, 2018. 
    In order to allow developers to prepare for JavaFX 11 and Java 11, early access builds of both Java 11
    and JavaFX 11 are made available.
    As of Java 11, the JavaFX framework is a standalone component. There are 2 different options for 
    developing JavaFX applications:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Download and install the <a target="_blank" href="https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/">JavaFX SDK</a></li>
    <li>Use a build system (e.g. maven/gradle) to download the required modules from Maven Central.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For both options, it is required to have a recent early access version of the 
    <a target="_blank" href="http://jdk.java.net/11/">Java 11 SDK</a>.
