<h2>Run HelloWorld using Maven</h2>

<p>
    If you want to develop JavaFX applications using maven, you don't have to download
    the OpenJFX SDK. Just specify the modules and the versions you want in the pom.xml,
    the build system will download the required modules, including the native libraries for your platform.
</p>
<p>
    Here is a <a href="pom.xml">pom.xml</a> file which shows how to achieve this.
</p>
<p>
    Run the application (e.g. use <a href="HelloFX.java">HelloFX.java</a>) using:
</p>

<pre><code>
mvn compile exec:java
</code></pre>

    <strong>Note: </strong>
    Make sure to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to JDK 11.
